Hey everyone,

I've been tinkering with Visual Studio 2022 and C++, trying to create a simple Calculator. But, wouldn't you know it, I've run into a bit of a snag â€“ there's a pesky bug hiding somewhere in the code! It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but I'm determined to track it down.
Once I've cracked the code and squashed that bug, you'll be the first to know. I'll be sure to update the project and let you all know when it's ready to roll.
In the meantime, if you're curious about the project or want to stay in the loop, you can catch more details and updates on my YouTube channel: potexxi25.

Thanks for your patience and support. Together, we'll get this Calculator up and running smoothly in no time!

Take care,
potexxi
